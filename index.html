The development is scheduled into six, two-week sprints in accordance with task priority and units of work from project backlog. Using Jira the tasks are distributed to team members based on skill set and units of work available. The scrum meetings are hosted by the project manager with team members four days a week. At the end of the two week sprint a review is held to discuss what was completed from the burnup log. A weekly meeting is held with faculty to discuss the current sprint. Any encountered issues can be posted on the Jira along with questions about tasks. The jira is updated by the development team to show progress of tasks or notify the other developers of bugs for the current sprint.
